Git == Version Control System

Version Control == Code Change Tracker

Directory == folder

Repository == Project == Main Directory

CLI == Command Line Interface

cd == Change Directory

Git == Code Change Tracker Tool

Github == Website that hosts our Git Repositories


Git Commands:
    - Clone     == Bring a repository that is hosted somwhere like Github into a folder on our local machine
    - Add       == Adds files to be tracked by Git
    - Commit    == Saves the changes that have been made
    - Push      == Uploades the Git Commits that have been made into the repo stored on Github


Rule:
    Add a file -> Commit the changes -> Push the commits
    Add -> Commit -> Push



Clone:
    git clone SSH_Key

    The SSH_Key can be found on the Green Code Button on the Github Repository
    The SSH_Key is a link/key that is unique to our repository

    After cloning, we will have a hidden .git folder, which contains info about
    our repository

GIT COMMANDS CAN WORK ONLY WHEN WE ARE INSIDE OF THE MAIN DIRECTORY(folder)
