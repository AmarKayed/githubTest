Git == Version Control System

Version Control == Code Change Tracker

Directory == folder

Repository == Project == Main Directory

CLI == Command Line Interface

cd == Change Directory

Git == Code Change Tracker Tool

GitHub == Website that hosts our Git Repositories


Git Commands:
    - Clone     == Bring a repository that is hosted somwhere like GitHub into a folder on our local machine
    - Status    == Shows the status of every tracked file
    - Add       == Adds files to be tracked by Git
    - Commit    == Saves the changes that have been made
    - Push      == Uploades the Git Commits that have been made into the repo stored on GitHub


Rule:
    Add a file -> Commit the changes -> Push the commits
    Add -> Commit -> Push



Clone:
    git clone SSH_Key

    The SSH_Key can be found on the Green Code Button on the Github Repository
    The SSH_Key is a link/key that is unique to our repository

    After cloning, we will have a hidden .git directory(folder), which contains info about
    our repository

    We can see all the hidden files by using the command: ls -la

GIT COMMANDS CAN WORK ONLY WHEN WE ARE INSIDE OF THE MAIN DIRECTORY(folder)


Status:
    git status

    Prints info about every tracked file:
        if it has unsaved(uncommited) changes
        if it has commited changes but has yet to be pushed on the GitHub Repo



Add:
    git add file

    it makes Git track the changes that will be made on the file
    if we want Git to track all the files in our current working directory, we simply use:
        git add .
